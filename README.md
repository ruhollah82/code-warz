# Algorithm Design Class Mini Project

This project is a mini project for an **Algorithm Design** class, created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Material-UI (MUI)**. It demonstrates the implementation of a **Merge Sort algorithm** to sort a list of players by their scores.

---

## Features

- **Add Players**: Input player names and scores.
- **Merge Sort Implementation**: Sort the list of players based on their scores using a custom implementation of Merge Sort.
- **Dynamic UI**: The user interface is built using Material-UI with a modern, glassy design.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile screens.

---

## Project Structure

- **`App.tsx`**: The main React component containing the player input form, sortable player table, and overall layout.
- **`utils/MergSort.ts`**: A utility function implementing the Merge Sort algorithm.
- **`components/theme.ts`**: Custom Material-UI theme configurations.
- **`types/player.ts`**: Type definitions for the Player object.
